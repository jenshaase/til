# Setup tubeless tires

## Preparation

* Remove tire from rim
* Clean rim and tire with soap water

## Rim tape

If there is already tubeless rim tape on the tire nothing needs to be done here.

* Clean the rim with alcohol to remove all the dirt. 
* Make sure the rim is dry before you start taping.
* Start with the tape between the first and second spoke (near the valve hole)
* Tape one round and overlap 10-15cm.
* While taping, keep the tape under pressure.
* Afterwards press the tape on the rim (with your fingers) and remove air bubbles.

## Insert the valve

* Find the value on your rim
* Use a needle to make a small hole into the tape
* Insert the valve by pushing the value through the little hole.
* Press the valve down into the rim.
* Mount he o-ring (not all valve have o-ring) and the nut.
* Tighten the nut

## Dry run

* Put the tire on the rim
* Remove the inner valve
* Use a compressor or Schwalbe Tire Booster to fill the tire with air.
* Insert the inner valve again
* Inflate the tire with a normal pump.
* Most of the air should now stay inside the tire, small airstreams can be closed with the sealing fluid in the next step

## Insert sealing fluid

* Remove a little bit of the tire from the rim
* Fill enought sealing fluid in the rim
* Turn the wheel, the sealing fluid will move away inside the tire
* Put the tire back on the rim
* Remove the inner valve
* Use a compressor or Schwalbe Tire Booster to fill the tire with air.
* Insert the inner valve again
* Inflate the tire with a normal pump.
* Turn the wheel, the sealing fluid will now fill the holes
* Ride your bike!

It may happend that the tire doesn't hold all the air after the first ride. Inflate the tire again and ride again.
